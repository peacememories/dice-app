# dice-app

A small elm-based app for rolling fudge dice.

While this project will hopefully soon work as a dice app, it was mostly created as an exploration into the Elm language and architecture. Because of this, the code should be expected to change dramatically, regularly.

## Building and Using

The project can be built into an html page using
```bash
elm make Main.elm
```

Or viewed by running
```
elm reactor
```
And navigating to the Main.elm site in a browser.
